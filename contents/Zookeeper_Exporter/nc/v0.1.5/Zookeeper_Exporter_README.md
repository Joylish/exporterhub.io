# zookeeper Exporter

A Prometheus exporter for zookeeper.

### What is zookeeper?
ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications.

Kafka internally use zookeeper.

This exporter can be used independently as well as with kafka to get the detailed metrics for the kafka cluster.

You can find all the metrics supported by the exporter in the "Zookeeper_Exporter_sample_metrics.md" file in the repository.


### Usage:

Exports mntr zookeeper's stats in prometheus format. zk_followers, zk_synced_followers and zk_pending_syncs metrics are available only on cluster leader.

Note: starting from zookeeper v3.4.10 it's required to have mntr command whitelisted (details: 4lw.commands.whitelist).

### Installing Zookeeper Exporter Charts: 
1- If your zookeeper is not up and ready you can start zookeepeer cluster using helm:

``` 
3- install the chart 
```access transformers
$ helm install [RELEASE_NAME] nexclipper/zookeeper-exporter
```
