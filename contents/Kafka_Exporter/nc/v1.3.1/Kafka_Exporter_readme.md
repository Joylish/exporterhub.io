# Kafka Exporter

A Prometheus exporter for [Apacher Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) metrics.

This chart bootstraps a [Kafka Exporter](https://github.com/danielqsj/kafka_exporter) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

### What is kafka?

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications.
Kafka uses Zookeeper to manage service discovery for Kafka Brokers that form the cluster. Zookeeper sends changes of the topology to Kafka, so each node in the cluster knows when a new broker joined, a Broker died, a topic was removed or a topic was added, etc.

This exporter exports metrics from the kafka such as topics, brokers, lag and many more.

You can see the details of the metrics exported by the exporter in "Kafka_Exporter_sample_metrics.md" file in the repository.  

### Usage:

The Kafka Exporter collects and exports kafka metrics such as consumer group lags, partitions and replications. 


### Installing Kafka Exporter Charts: 
1- If your kafka is not up and ready you can start kafka cluster using helm:
```access transformers
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/kafka
```

2- Add kafka exporter helm repo 
```access transformers
$ helm repo add nexclipper [https://nexclipper.github.io/helm-charts]
$ helm repo update
``` 
3- install the chart 
```access transformers
$ helm install [RELEASE_NAME] nexclipper/kafka-exporter
```

Note: for helm v2 add `--name` before [RELEASE_NAME]. ex:  `helm install --name  [RELEASE_NAME] nexclipper/kafka-exporter`

4- To see the metrics run 
```access transformers
  kubectl port-forward service/[RELEASE_NAME]-prometheus-kafka-exporter 9308

```
Visit http://127.0.0.1:9308 to see the metrics

### Configuration 

#### Charts Configuration

To see all configurable options with detailed comments, visit the chart's values.yaml or run these configuration commands:

```console
# Helm 2
$ helm inspect values nexclipper/kafka-exporter

# Helm 3
$ helm show values nexclipper/kafka-exporter
```

Values.yaml file that specifies the values for the above parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
$ helm install my-release -f values.yaml nexclipper/kafka-exporter
```


### Test your setup

If you do not have a readymade application to test the stack you can use the sample application below:

Kafka needs a producer and consumer

To deploy a porducer run the follwing command:

```console
kubectl run kafka-producer --image=quay.io/rhdevelopers/kafka-tutorial-song-app:springboot -n kafka

```

Port-forward the producer

```console
kubectl port-forward pod/kafka-producer 8080 -n kafka
```

Publish the message to get the data

```console
http POST localhost:8080/test id=1000111 name=Portals author='Alan Silvestri'
```

To deploy a consumer run the folling command:

```console
kubectl run kafka-consumer --image=quay.io/rhdevelopers/kafka-tutorial-song-indexer-app:springboot -n kafka
```
